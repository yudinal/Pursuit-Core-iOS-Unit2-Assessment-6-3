# The Assessment

### Overview

Your app will display a table full of crayon colors. Clicking on a color will bring you to a view that lets you mess around with that color's red, green, blue and alpha values.

### Project Componenets:

Inside this repo, you will find a `Crayon` model that has:

```swift
var name: String
var red: Double
var green: Double
var blue: Double
var hex: String
static let allTheCrayons: [Crayon]
```

In the project is also an empty Storyboard.  You have no existing View Controllers, so you will need to create your own.

### The Requirements 

Load `allTheCrayons` into a `Table View`.  

- The name in each row should be the `Crayon`'s **name**.  
- The subtitle in each row should be the `Crayon`'s **hex** value.  
- The background color of each row should be the `Crayon`'s color (derived from the `Crayon`'s **red**, **green** and **blue**.  

When the user selects a row, you should segue to a Detail View.   The Detail view should have:

- A background color that starts as the same color as the selected `Crayon`.
- A `UILabel` to show the **name** of the selected `Crayon`
- A `UISlider` and `UILabel` that represent the current **red** value
- A `UISlider` and `UILabel` that represent the current **green** value
- A `UISlider` and `UILabel` that represent the current **blue** value
- A `UIStepper` and `UILabel` that represents the current **alpha**
- A reset `UIButton` that sets all the sliders and labels to be the corresponding colors of the Crayon the user selected and resets the alpha to 1.0.

The values of each of the sliders should start at the appropriate values from the selected Crayon.  The range of each slider should be between 0.0 and 1.0. 

The value of the stepper should start at 1.0.  The range of the stepper should be from 0.0 to 1.0.

The labels should display the decimal value of each of red, green, blue, and alpha. As the user manipulates the sliders and stepper, the background color should change accordingly in real time.


### Steps to achieve MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

1. Set the background color of the rows by building a `UIColor` from the `Crayon` model's red, green, and blue properties, and set the labels' text to the `Crayon`'s name and hex values. You **don't** need to make a custom `TableViewCell`
to do this. Just use the default `UITableViewCell`.

1. Implement `prepare(for:)` on your `View Controller` or `TableViewController` in order to pass the `Crayon` information over to the Detail `ViewController`. This Detail `ViewController` should have a label displaying the name, and should color its background just as you did with the table cell row. The `Sliders` should be in the correct positions as specified by the tapped `Crayon`'s **RGB values**.

1. Build your Detail `ViewController`: connect outlets and actions to the  `Slider` and `Stepper` controls and your `Labels`. Use one `Label` to display the `Crayon`'s name. Add a `Label` below each `Slider` and one below the `Stepper` that will live-update when the `Sliders` or `Stepper` change their values.

1. Set up your `Slider`s to increase or decrease the `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue` values by a set interval when dragged left/right.

1. Set up your `Stepper` to increase or decrease your `Alpha` value by **0.1** when tapped. 

1. Add a `UIButton` which should reset all your sliders/stepper/labels to their appropriate staring values based on the passed in `Crayon`.


#### A note on color

The following initializer will be helpful:

```swift
UIColor(displayP3Red:green:blue:alpha:)
```

All four arguments to the initializer are of type `CGFloat` and expect a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

The doubles provided for the `Crayon` values are from 0 from 255.  You will need to convert them proportionally to the appropriate `CGFloat` by dividing by 255.



#### Extra Credit
Do any of the below, or none at all:

1. Create a convenience initializer on the `Crayon` model that uses the `hex` property to initialize the red, green, blue properties in a `Crayon`. 

1. Use `TextFields`, instead of `Labels`, to show each RGB value. Typing in a value manually should affect the respective slider's positions and update the background color.

1. Have the `Labels` change to a lighter color to make them easier to read once the view gets too dark.

1. Create a segmented control with two titles "Decimal" and "Hex".  If "Decimal" is selected, the labels should all be in decimal between 0 and 1.  If "Hex" is selected, the labels should all be in hex between 0 and FF.
